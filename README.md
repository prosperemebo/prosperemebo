<br>

I'm a Software engineer excited about building applications that solve real-world problems. I achieve this by utilizing the MERN stack to build intuitive frontend and backend systems. With my creative and problem-solving skills, I'm able to make critical decisions, through teamwork, collaborations, and projects.

**Here's a quick summary about me**:

- 🌱 I’m currently building projects with Node.js
- 👀 I’m interested in the Javascript ecosystem for MERN developers
- 😊 I’m looking for help with open-source projects, hackathons, internships, and entry-level opportunities.
- 💼 Job interests: Software Engineer, Front Engineer, Backend Engineer or UI Engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack projects, I can also jump on fun web3 projects. (I've worked on an NFT project before)
